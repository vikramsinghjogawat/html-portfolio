<h1>Vikram's Best Movies of All Time</h1>
<h2>Here are my top recommendations</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1970</h3>
<p>Casted with some of the most legendary actors in Indian cinema, thrilling music and a patriotic story binding the emotions of POW's.<br /> 
This movie is quite literally the best combination and quite underrated according to me.</p>

<h3>Intersteller</h3>
<p>From the music to CGI visuals created a masterpiece on time travel which leaves you with a lot to think about our place in the universe.</p>

<h3>Gangajal</h3>
<p>Prequal of the Singham with more realistic fights and a lot of smoking scences. :)</p>
